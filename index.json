Gradio is a free and open-source Python library that allows you to develop an easy-to-use customizable component demo for your machine learning model that anyone can use anywhere.\nWith the rise of diffuser models for image generation, AI is democratized and becomes accessible to a larger number of people. It is no longer necessary to have programming skills to be able to experiment with state-of-the-art models: simple web interfaces created by the community allow in a few clicks to have fun with the latest models implemented at Hugging Face ü§ó.\nTry this demo that I developed to describe an image using a Transformer model. I developed this demo to answer a request given in Hugging Face\u0026rsquo;s Transformer GitHub repository. The request was to have a tool that reproduces the results we can see in the fig.4 of the original ViLT paper.\nShort tutorial to get the heatmap that indicates how much information is transported from a chosen word token :\nFirst, provide the Url of an image and give a caption where you hide the words you want to be filled by a [MASK] token. Then, choose the index of the token you want to get the heatmap from with the slider bar. In this example, we chose the first [MASK] token (10th word). The result of the heatmap should be the following :\nThank you for reading my first post ! If you liked this demo, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to share it.\n","date":"October 2, 2022","hero":"/images/posts/first/gradio.png","permalink":"https://mikailintech.github.io/posts/introduction/","summary":"Hiüëãüèº, welcome to my first post.\nFor my first post, I want to introduce to you Gradio.
