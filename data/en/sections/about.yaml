# a summary about you
summary: "I recently graduated from PSL University’s AI Master of Science. Before this experience, I spent three years at Télécom SudParis where I specialized in Data and Statistics. During my last years, my courses ranged from basic software skills to advanced deep learning theory and application. You can check some of the projects I developed on my Github. 

I did two 6 months internships at Safran Electronics & Defense and Inria Saclay. During the first one, I had to dive deep into statistical algorithms such as Kalman Filters and Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) Filters. Despite the extent of what I have learned, I felt that I wanted to specialize in Machine and Deep learning-related fields. For my last internship, I worked on a meaningful project while studying and building state-of-the-art Deep learning models such as cGANs. 

Now that I am fresh graduate, I dedicate my time to continue learning by participating in Kaggle competitions or trying to contribute to open-source.

If you think that we could work together in a dynamic team or collaborate on an innovative project, feel free to reach me."
