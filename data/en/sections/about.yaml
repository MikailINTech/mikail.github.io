# a summary about you
summary: "I recently graduated from PSL University’s AI Master of Science. Before this experience, I spent three years at Télécom SudParis where I specialized in Data and Statistics.
My competency range from basic software skills to advanced deep learning theory and application, and I have had the opportunity to put these skills into practice through my experiences in both a company and a laboratory. 
My education and experience make me well-equipped to tackle complex business and research problems, and I am always excited to bring my skills and knowledge to new challenges.
Whether you are looking for a data-driven solution to a business problem or a skilled person with a strong background in AI, feel free to reach me, I believe I would be a great fit for your needs."
